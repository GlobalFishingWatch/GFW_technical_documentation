Vessel meet up at sea for a variety of reasons, including transshipment (transferring catch, crew, fuel, etc.), and these encounters between vessels are of interest for monitoring illegal behavior.

## Data Description

When two vessels are both observed moving very slowly in close proximity for an extended period of time it is considered and **encounter**. If only one vessel is observed operating in this fashion, it is considered a **loitering event**. Loitering events are important because they may indicate that the vessel is encountering another vessel that is not broadcasting AIS.

## Caveats & Known Issues

### Overlapping detection

Due to the definition of encounter and loitering events, loitering events can overlap with encounter events.
