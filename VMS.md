# VMS Data Sources

As part of our Transparency Initiative, select countries have agreed to share their proprietary Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data with GFW. These data are distinct from the AIS data and their format and contents vary by country. Below is an overview of the data available in BigQuery for each VMS partner.

> Each data sharing agreement between GFW and country partners has specific restrictions on data access and sharing. In general, GFW  must request written permission to use the VMS data for use cases other than the public map and analyses for the country partner. For more information, see the [Overview of VMS Data and Use Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J6CFWGwILjlBwuuv33DqjG9iQ_0eOIy-5U-o_RkGKtg/edit?usp=sharing) doc.
