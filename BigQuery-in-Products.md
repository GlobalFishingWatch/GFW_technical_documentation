## APIs

GFW’s API’s provide a set of instructions for software to access select GFW data and information. An API retrieves and delivers data to both front-end and back-end applications. Currently GFW has two API’s used in products. The earliest version (version 0) used in the Carrier Vessel Portal (CVP), and then the current version (version 1) used in all other GFW products (GFW Map and Marine Manager).

At this time the use of GFW API’s is limited to GFW products, although GFW’s API’s make it feasible for our data to be hosted on the maps of collaborating organizations (like SeaVision). 

### Version 0
The Version 0 API is used exclusively in the CVP and has been updated to mimic the Version 1 API (using the same datasets as the Version 1 API and similar data restrictions). It is still to be decided if the CVP will remain a stand alone product, or be merged into the GFW Map or into another product. If the CVP remains a stand alone product, future efforts will be made to update the portal to support the Version 1 API. 

### Version 1 
The Version 1 API is used in the GFW Map, Marine Manager, and Vessel Viewer. In the future all GFW products will use this API. The queries used to curate date for the V1 API can be found [here](https://datasets.globalfishingwatch.org/)  (Username: datasets | Password: gfw_doc). Within the queries are the BQ source datasets.

**Upcoming/Future Plans**
+ A wrapper in R is being developed so that GFW API’s can be easily used in R in the future. When tools like these are created we will be able to help partners and interested individuals of the public be able to directly query data included on our public portals.

## [Carrier Vessel Portal (CVP)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/carrier-vessel-portal/) | v0 API

The Carrier Vessel Portal (CVP) uses publicly available data from 2017 through the present to identify potential vessel encounters and loitering events. It synthesizes fishing registry information to create a picture of potential authorizations for both carrier and fishing vessels involved in transshipment activity. 

**Data in the Portal**
+ V0 API | [Current CVP queries](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pipe-carrier-portal/tree/master/assets/bigquery)
+ The output of the current CVP queries can be found in BigQuery under the bin name `proj_carrier_portal_pew`

**Data Restrictions in Portal**
+ **Encounters** are limited to those between carriers and fishing vessels and support and fishing vessels
+ **Loitering events** are limited to those by carrier vessels with a minimum duration of 1 hour. 
+ **Port visits** are limited to Confidence 4 visits. For more information see [Anchorages and Voyages](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/bigquery-documentation-wf827/wiki/Anchorages-and-voyages) wiki 
+ Information on **vessel authorization** is updated on two month lag 

**Unique Features (compared to GFW Map):** Authorization Data, Port visits

+ [CVP Disclaimers](https://globalfishingwatch.org/carrier-vessel-portal-disclaimers/)
+ [Authorization Records](https://globalfishingwatch.org/authorization-records/)
+ [GFW Product Tutorials](https://globalfishingwatch.org/tutorials/)

**Upcoming/Future Plans**
+ If the CVP is maintained as a standalone product, then queries will be updated and V1 API will be used

**Updates**
+ Feb 15, 2022: CVP data updated on a 3 day lag rather than monthly update. CVP encounters code now pulls encounters from published_events_encounters and identified carrier, support, and fishing vessel  by_year tables.
+ Nov 2021: v0 API updated port visits and loitering events on CVP to pull from pipe_production_vYYYYMMDD published events ports and loitering tables. Port visits in the published events table are limited to confidence = 4. The loitering events logic has been changed to group points at seg_id level and not ssvid, and thus the number of loitering events in some areas increased noticeably due to some long loitering events now being grouped as many small loitering events.

## [GFW Map](https://globalfishingwatch.org/map/) | v1 API
The Global Fishing Watch map is the "main" GFW product. The map merges multiple types of vessel tracking data to provide a view of global human activity at sea, including fishing activity, encounters between vessels, night light vessel detection and vessel presence. The map includes global fishing activity from 2012 to the present from more than 65,000 commercial fishing vessels that are responsible for a significant part of global seafood catch. Users can search for vessels, filter activity by flag State or time period, identify port visits and view encounters between vessels. The map also allows anyone to upload and overlay their own data, download aggregated fishing reports of activity from custom areas, and save and share what is on the current view.

**Data in the Portal**
+ V1 API | [V1 API Queries](https://datasets.globalfishingwatch.org/)  (Username: datasets | Password: gfw_doc). 
+ Within the V1 API Queries are the BQ source datasets.

## [Vessel Viewer](https://globalfishingwatch.org/vessel-viewer) | v1 API
![](https://github.com/willabrooksGFW/gfw_photos/blob/main/vessel_viewer_screenshot.png)
The Vessel Viewer, formally the Port Inspector App, is geared towards Port Inspectors and is currently being prototyped in the field. The App's objective is to provide relevant information for port inspectors to assist them in identifying vessels which should be prioritized for inspection upon arrival in port.

At this time the Vessel Viewer is currently in development and available to GFW staff for internal use.
