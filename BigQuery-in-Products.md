## [Product Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JY0umwJ5j8qFpOb90OuaUOo43y45yExaenNWzUlbkCo/edit)

This page highlights the data included in products; bigquery source tables, API code, and data restrictions applied to the data. Additionally, updates to data in products, such as changes in source data tables or changes in restrictions to the data are outlined. Resources on how to use and interact with products are linked. 

| | V0 API | V1/V2 API | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Product | [CVP](https://globalfishingwatch.org/carrier-vessel-portal/) | [GFW Map](https://globalfishingwatch.org/map/), <br> [Marine Manager](https://globalfishingwatch.org/marine-manager-portal/), <br> [Vessel Viewer](https://globalfishingwatch.org/vessel-viewer), <br> [API Portal](https://globalfishingwatch.org/ocean-engine/tokens/signup) | All products use same API with the exception of the CVP which uses an earlier version API. The plan is to update the CVP to using the same APIs as other the other products in the future. |

## [Carrier Vessel Portal (CVP)](https://globalfishingwatch.org/carrier-vessel-portal/) | v0 API

The Carrier Vessel Portal (CVP) uses publicly available data from 2017 through the present to identify potential vessel encounters and loitering events. It synthesizes fishing registry information to create a picture of potential authorizations for both carrier and fishing vessels involved in transshipment activity. The CVP is the only Product using the v0 API, although, in the future, the Product and Engineering team will look to transition the CVP to using the same API as the other Products.

**Data in the Portal**
+ V0 API | [Current CVP queries](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pipe-carrier-portal/tree/master/assets/bigquery)
+ The output of the current CVP queries can be found in BigQuery under the bin name `pipe_carrier_portal_production_v20220124`

**Data Restrictions in Portal**
+ **Encounters** are limited to those between carriers and fishing vessels and support and fishing vessels
+ **Loitering events** are limited to those by carrier vessels with a minimum duration of 1 hour. 
+ **Port visits** are limited to Confidence 4 visits. For more information see [Anchorages and Voyages](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/bigquery-documentation-wf827/wiki/Anchorages-and-voyages) wiki 
+ Information on **vessel authorization** is updated on two month lag 

**Unique Features (compared to GFW Map):** Authorization Data, Port visits

+ [CVP FAQs](https://globalfishingwatch.org/help-faqs/)
+ [CVP Disclaimers](https://globalfishingwatch.org/carrier-vessel-portal-disclaimers/)
+ [Authorization Records](https://globalfishingwatch.org/authorization-records/)
+ [GFW Product Tutorials](https://globalfishingwatch.org/tutorials/)

**Upcoming/Future Plans**
+ If the CVP is maintained as a standalone product, then queries will be updated and V1 API will be used

**Updates**
+ Feb 15, 2022: CVP data updated on a 3 day lag rather than monthly update. CVP encounters code now pulls encounters from published_events_encounters and identified carrier, support, and fishing vessel  by_year tables.
+ Nov 2021: v0 API updated port visits and loitering events on CVP to pull from pipe_production_vYYYYMMDD published events ports and loitering tables. Port visits in the published events table are limited to confidence = 4. The loitering events logic has been changed to group points at seg_id level and not ssvid, and thus the number of loitering events in some areas increased noticeably due to some long loitering events now being grouped as many small loitering events.

## [API Portal](https://globalfishingwatch.org/ocean-engine/tokens/signup) | v1 API 

GFW’s API’s provide a set of instructions for software to access select GFW data and information. An API retrieves and delivers data to both front-end and back-end applications. 

The GFW API Portal makes it feasible for our data to be hosted on the maps of collaborating organizations (like SeaVision). The API Portal launched on July 19th, 2022. A wrapper package in R, named `gfwr`, also launched alongside the API Portal, and allows individuals to call data from the API Portal directly into R.   

**APIs Resources**

+ R package to access API Portal: A [wrapper in R](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr) has been developed so that GFW's API Portal data can be easily used in R. The package named `gfwr` can now be accessed. [Slack thread.](https://globalfishingwatch.slack.com/archives/C026FKDJGMT/p1654885678794689)

## [GFW Map](https://globalfishingwatch.org/map/) | v1 API
The Global Fishing Watch map is the "main" GFW product. The map merges multiple types of vessel tracking data to provide a view of global human activity at sea, including fishing activity, encounters between vessels, night light vessel detection and vessel presence. The map includes global fishing activity from 2012 to the present from more than 65,000 commercial fishing vessels that are responsible for a significant part of global seafood catch. Users can search for vessels, filter activity by flag State or time period, identify port visits and view encounters between vessels. The map also allows anyone to upload and overlay their own data, download aggregated fishing reports of activity from custom areas, and save and share what is on the current view.

**Data in the Portal**
+ V1 API | [V1 API Queries](https://datasets.globalfishingwatch.org/)  (Username: datasets | Password: gfw_doc). 
+ Within the V1 API Queries are the BQ source datasets.

## [Vessel Viewer](https://globalfishingwatch.org/vessel-viewer) | v1 API
The Vessel Viewer, formally the Port Inspector App, is geared towards Port Inspectors and is currently being prototyped in the field. The App's objective is to provide relevant information for port inspectors to assist them in identifying vessels which should be prioritized for inspection upon arrival in port.

At this time the Vessel Viewer is currently in development and available to GFW staff for internal use. 

Vessel Viewer is part of GFWs broader effort to develop a suite of vessel intelligence tools to support (1) port inspection, (2) patrol planning, (3) insurance underwriting and (4) supply chain management to mitigate IUU risk.
