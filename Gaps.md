AIS devices are designed to continually broadcast a vessel's position every few seconds (Class A) or every 30 seconds (Class B). However, for various reasons, these signals may not always be received, resulting in gaps in an MMSI's AIS coverage. Knowing when and where these gap events start and stop is important as they can indicate potentially illegal behavior.
