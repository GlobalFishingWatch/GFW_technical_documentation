This data set is derived from the Marine Regions high-seas data set by extracting just the polygons corresponding to the 15 high seas pockets that GFW has labeled from HSP-1 to HSP-15. Note that HSP-15 is split across the anti-meridian, so it appears in two pieces that have the same label. Naming of the pockets is consistent with the naming that WCPFC uses to identify HSP 1-4. The rest of the pockets are enumerated in arbitrary order by GFW.

The script used to create the layer is here: [https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pipe-regions/blob/PIPELINE-1049/layer-preprocessing/high-seas-pockets.sh](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pipe-regions/blob/PIPELINE-1049/layer-preprocessing/high-seas-pockets.sh)
