The coverage metric was first released in Vessel Viewer (prototype) in 2023 as a contextual piece of information to help users identify how useful/complete the activity summary for the vessel being searched is. The coverage metric is a percentage representing the proportion of one hour blocks a vessel is in a voyage and has at least one AIS transmission. See Data Description section for more information. 


## Key Tables

+ There is no key table for coverage. Coverage is instead calculated in the API without an associated BigQuery table, because coverage is calculated every day (with a 3 day delay) for a vessels activity in the previous year. The coverage value therefore must be recalculated every day, and also must consider if you are vessel records being manually merged together, which requires individual calculations for every manual merge configuration. 

## Source Tables

+ `world-fishing-827.pipe_v20201001_api.indicators_coverage_blocks` - daily hourly coverage rate per vessel_id. Each vessel_id lists for every day the number of hours the vessel was active, and the number of hours were at least one AIS transmission was counted. In this way, this table provides a daily coverage value which gets aggregated together in the API to get an overall coverage value. See example query section for query which illustrates how to nearly replicate the coverage calculation seen in Vessel Viewer. 
+ `pipe_production_v20201001.vessel_info` - used to set the date range for a vessels activity (vessel_id resolution)

## Data Description

+ **Coverage definition in Vessel Viewer:** The coverage metric is an estimate of how well a vessel's activities, i.e. where it traveled and what it did, can be captured by AIS data. To calculate it, all voyages linked to a vessel in the last year (i.e. 12 months) are segmented into one hour blocks and the total number of blocks with at least one AIS transmission are counted. The coverage metric is a percentage representing the proportion of one hour blocks a vessel is in a voyage and has at least one AIS transmission.


## Caveats and Known Issues

+ **One hour intervals:** Coverage is evaluated by looking at the frequency a vessel transmits on AIS at least once every hour. Depending on the use case or the area where a vessel is active, evaluating coverage on one hour intervals may result in low coverage. For instance, in some areas satellite reception may be low, resulting in low coverage subsequently. Fishing vessels frequently transmit Class B AIS, which has a less frequent ping rate that could result in lower coverage. These factors and others are important to consider when trying to understand the value/meaning of the coverage metric. 
+ **One year intervals:** In Products, the coverage metric is calculated for the past year of activity with a three day delay. If a vessel of interest has primarily been active during at time not in the past year, then the coverage value is not very useful. However coverage can manually be calculated in BigQuery in these cases. See Example Queries for more.   

## Example Queries
** if trying to replicate coverage in Vessel Viewer, user should define time range for one year period considering 3 day delay. For example if user looks at coverage in Vessel Viewer on Oct 20th 2023, then date range in example query should be set for Oct 17th 2023 to Oct 17th 2022.
