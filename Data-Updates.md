**Running list of updates to note in regard to Global Fishing Watch data and data changes**

Do not forget to update the version of the tables in the [BigQuery Table Reference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B8Q04rzWRdffty2gVBlHiBDS9DYZLdW8J-4B3xja5ws/edit#gid=0).


**August 3, 2021 Updates**:
* Automated loitering data ready for use. Previously we only had occasionally updating loitering data, now it is fully automated to update everyday (with a 72 hour delay). The detailed documentation on these new tables, and what else was updated in the logic can be found in _Loitering_ wiki page. Along with new examples in the examples folder: https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/bigquery-documentation-wf827/tree/master/queries/examples/current

**July 30, 2021 Updates**:
* The [Big Query datasets](BigQuery-datasets) page has been updated to reflect the new data staging process, which you will notice based on the series of new datasets that will be shared soon. 
* New port visit and voyage tables are ready for use as PROTOTYPES (see _Big Query datasets_ for what it means to be a prototype dataset). The detailed documentation on these new tables can be found in _Ports and Voyages_ wiki page.
