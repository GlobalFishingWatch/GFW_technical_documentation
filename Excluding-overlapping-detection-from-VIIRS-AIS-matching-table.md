Single VIIRS overpass from North to South at night can be distinguishable using OrbitNumber. and Successive VIIRS overpass have overlapping region. To eliminat the overlapping, We will choose overpass (i.e OrbitNumber) with smaller satelite zenith angle for each 0.1 degree grid area for each day.


# Example query

```sql
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION start_date() AS (DATE('2020-01-01'));
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION end_date() AS (DATE('2020-01-02'));
